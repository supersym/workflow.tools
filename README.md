workflow.tools
==============

A simple setup to expand upon which tools/scripts I want standardized. This
repository is comforably located at ~/bin but of course you could locate these
anywhere inside your path.

It includes it's own `node_modules/` folder which contain common tools used in
combination with the command line. There also might be `Python` programs for
which we did not include libraries as these are installed per package manager /
pip.
